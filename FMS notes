FMS notes from Andy:

Spreadsheet has:
  Heights in left column
  Everything else showing Widths
  Vertically consumes enough rows to accomplish height in pixels
  Every row contains widths - that's a lot of repetition.

Panel #6
Paint Shop Pro gives pixel locations for Corners

On CD
in server_root\files\fms\*area*
where *area*=m_net or particular screen
Java script files have spreadsheet numbers embedded in arrays at the top
"columns" has pixel width of each column
"rows" contains pixel height of each row
"matrix" is points to "cell" entry for action/behavior of each row x 
column area of the screen
"cells" has definition of action
  Definition is:
    1) Text to appear in box
    2) Name of CSS element
    3) id (variable) is the name by which this gets referenced
    4) on-click - function called when clik occurs
    5) mouse over
    6) mouse out

An area must have an ID to display stuff of be changeable from teh 
program (flash, color content etc.) in any way.
Convention is that a screen will only have mouse over/out of entrires 
for selectable/click-able areas.

Stealing code: Do this lots. What you need is somewhere on the CD.

Manual for behaviors (but incomplete. See Andy's brain for rest.)
How does whatever get back to server?

Good questions. Answer is that there's a chunk of code running every 500 
milliseconds (0.5 seconds) that gets data items from the database. It 
calls a function ?every time something changes? (That would be nice.)
There are also functions for sending data items to the data base.

So, the database is used to communicate between code running in various 
browsers (java script) and server.

This is mostly transparent to us except for function that gets called on 
data arriving and function we call to send data items.

To find this stuff search for "M_NET"

We looked at a chunk of code that returns attribute string that's an 
m_net request which gets red_count
(Note: UPPERCASE is used for "constants")
('+' is "concatenation [stack together] the string equivalent of the 
value being concatenated.)

process_data_item is called by network  when something comes back from 
the server
Is sent in "tag=value" where "tag" is a number specifying the data item.

(Polling rate is nominally 500msec.)

Data item IDs in "CD:\server_root\files\fms\m_net folder" (functions are 
there, too)

nominal "correct" (designed for) screen width = 1280
Is there automation of spreadsheet to Java script Arrays?? No. (Darn!)

"Done" means "customer can walk in and buy it."

Server IP is 10.10.142.55
