Hello Programmers! Please follow the below steps and dont bother the leads about it. (num1, no questions)

  1) make sure all possible* and avalible panels are gridded (ruler and pen) and their pixel locations counted.

  2) once the above step is DONE, FIND the code that exists to manipulate that panel and make the code work.

  3) if there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do, go to code academy and learn HTML/CSS and JavaScript

      -if you have finished those move onto another language, work on long term homework, or find a way to make the FMS work go faster
  
  4) when you have to, go home

  *possible: panels that have been created and drawn and are ready to be worked on, if they arent there, dont work on them, and dont ask about them
