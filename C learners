C Programmers
=============

Good job, if you are working on learning c, you are in the correect file!
Please follow the instructions carefully, have fun and good luck!

open http://www.codepad.org, then open a new tab with the below link and follow the tutorials, 
writing the code in codepad.

    - http://www.physics.drexel.edu/courses/Comp_Phys/General/C_basics/

when you finish a lesson, copy your code onto a text file and save it to either your flash drive or your w:/ or o:/ drives

if you get done with those tutorials, then go to 

    - http://randu.org/tutorials/c/io.php

and do them, following the same instructions.

remember: 
- keep file naming systems SIMPLE like Drexel_Lesson_1 or Randu_Lesson_2
- NO SPACES IN FILENAMES
- if you have questions, ask those around you that are WORKING ON THE SAME THING AS YOU, 
- do NOT bother the FMS team or Melia or Corey, they are busy. 
- If you are truly stuck then, and ONLY THEN may you come ask MELIA for help.
