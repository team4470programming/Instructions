C Programmers
=============

Good job, if you are working on learning c, you are in the correect file!
Please follow the instructions carefully, have fun and good luck!

open http://www.codepad.org, then open a new tab with the below link and follow the tutorials, 
writing the code in codepad.

    - http://www.physics.drexel.edu/courses/Comp_Phys/General/C_basics/

when you finish a lesson, copy your code onto a text file and save it to either your flash drive or your w:/ or o:/ drives

if you get done with those tutorials, then go to 

    - http://randu.org/tutorials/c/io.php

and do them, following the same instructions. I know some of the lesson are the same, if you dont want to do those tutorials, find some other tutorials that you can do. work with syntax, create games, have fun.

ONLY do this if you have completed the first set of tutorials, I will not tolerate hearing about anyone fooling around and not on task or not doing what they were supposed to. If that happens, it will leave me less inclined to let you guys work on your own with minimal supervision.

remember: 
- keep file naming systems SIMPLE like Drexel_Lesson_1 or Randu_Lesson_2
- NO SPACES IN FILENAMES
- if you have questions, ask those around you that are WORKING ON THE SAME THING AS YOU, 
- do NOT bother the FMS team or Melia or Corey, they are busy. 
- If you are truly stuck then, and ONLY THEN may you come ask MELIA for help.
